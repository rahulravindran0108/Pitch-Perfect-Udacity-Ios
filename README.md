# Pitch Perfect

An iOS app created as part of my first project in the iOS Nanodegree program. This project uses some basic functionality like segues and uses voice synthesis.

## Project Specifications

The Pitch Perfect app allows users to record a sound using the device's microphone. It then allows users to play the recorded sound back with six different sound modulations:

Super Slow
Super Fast
Chipmunk
Darth Vader
Parrot (Echo effect)
Reverb
